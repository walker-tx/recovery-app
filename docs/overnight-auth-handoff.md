# Overnight auth handoff

This file is the durable handoff for `docs/overnight-auth-plan.md`. Agents must verify it against Git and repository state before acting.

- **Current section:** 3. Build the password welcome and returning-user sign-in screens
- **Next action:** correct
- **Last known-good commit:** `0dff1a7` (`Approve protected auth routes`); section 3 implementation commit `62bd24f` remains green but is not approved.
- **Correction cycles for current section:** 1
- **Last successful checks:** Review reran `mise exec -- pnpm --filter @recovery/mobile exec node --experimental-strip-types --test src/features/auth/auth-policy.test.ts src/features/auth/auth-submission.test.ts` (5/5 passed, with the existing module-type warnings), `mise exec -- pnpm --filter @recovery/backend run check` (passed), and `git diff --check HEAD^ HEAD` (passed). Implementation checks also passed mobile TypeScript, the auth route contract, `mise run check` 2/2, and Expo Doctor 17/17.
- **Tests added in current section:** `auth-policy.test.ts` recorded the intended red `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for the missing normalization, ten-character guidance, and safe-error policy, then passed 3/3. `auth-submission.test.ts` recorded the intended red `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for the missing submission guard, then passed 2/2; fresh review found that its value-retention assertion is disconnected from both the guard and rendered form state, so it proves retry unlock but not retained credentials.
- **Review status:** Fresh section 3 review found two blocking issues in `62bd24f`: sign-in incorrectly reapplies the ten-character creation/reset rule and can reject valid existing eight- or nine-character credentials; the claimed value-retention test is vacuous. Architecture, route/feature boundaries, local state ownership, duplicate suppression, mobile error sanitization, and the deterministic Convex authz scan had no blocking findings.
- **Blocking condition:** Correct the two verified section 3 findings with regression tests first. The package's direct sign-in errors/timing remain an inherited nonblocking limitation for this milestone because the documented protocol privacy gates defer signup/reset while the mobile returning-user flow sanitizes every displayed failure. Mixed-case legacy account population was not inspected and is an open local-data compatibility question, not a verified finding.
- **Next bounded action:** Add regression coverage that accepts an existing eight- or nine-character sign-in password without weakening the ten-character creation/reset rule, and replace the disconnected value-retention assertion with a test of state actually used by the sign-in flow. Demonstrate both tests red, apply the smallest fix, rerun focused mobile/backend/package checks, preserve correction count `1`, and set Next action to review. Do not begin profile onboarding.

## Section 3 fresh review of `62bd24f`

Two blocking findings require one correction cycle:

1. **P2 correctness/product — sign-in revalidates legacy credentials.** `apps/mobile/src/features/auth/auth-policy.ts` and `packages/backend/convex/auth.ts` reject every password shorter than ten characters before credential verification. Pinned Auth 0.0.95 previously allowed creation with its eight-character default, and its `validatePasswordRequirements` hook intentionally runs only for `signUp` and `reset-verification`. The returning-user flow must not lock out an otherwise valid existing eight- or nine-character credential. Preserve the ten-character rule for future credential creation/reset without applying it during sign-in.
2. **P2 test quality — value retention is not tested.** `auth-submission.test.ts` compares a standalone `values` object that is never passed to the guard, callback, or screen. The assertion necessarily passes even if the rendered form clears both fields. Replace it with regression coverage over state that the sign-in flow actually owns; keep the meaningful retry-unlock assertion.

Nonblocking findings and residual gaps: direct-entry Back fallback and stale form-error clearing are P3 hardening candidates; rendered double-tap, successful local-backend sign-in, keyboard, compact-layout, enlarged-text, and assistive-technology checks remain unverified. Pinned Auth's direct public sign-in action has account-dependent error/timing behavior inherited from the parent provider configuration; the mobile flow does not display those raw errors, and the accepted protocol-level deferrals remain limited to signup/verification/reset. Deterministic Convex authz scanning found no client-supplied identity, missing document-ownership check, PII-by-ID query, or unchecked parent-container write in application Convex code. No production code was edited during review, and no deployment-affecting command ran.

Fresh read-only lenses covered correctness, architecture, simplicity, security/privacy, Convex authorization, accessibility, adversarial behavior, product fidelity, tooling, and test quality. An independent skeptic confirmed both blockers after inspecting the repository contract and pinned provider source.

## Section 3 implementation

The welcome and returning-user sign-in routes now compose capability screens under `features/auth`. The sign-in screen preserves email/password values after failure, disables editable controls while pending, blocks immediate duplicate auth calls synchronously, supplies email/password autofill and keyboard metadata, and renders validation/provider failures as non-color-only alerts without displaying raw provider errors. The provider profile is the server-side normalization boundary and rejects every Password flow except `signIn`, preserving the accepted signup/reset deferrals.

Red evidence was captured before production files existed. Both test commands failed specifically because their imported policy/submission modules were absent; no red state was committed. After implementation, the combined focused run passed all five assertions. An initial mobile TypeScript check exposed missing Node test types and an invalid typed absolute route; adding the section's test type dependency/config and using the typed relative route resolved those failures before the final green checks. No deployment-affecting command was run.

## Section 2 review

Fresh read-only lenses covered correctness, architecture, simplicity, security/privacy, accessibility, adversarial behavior, product fit, and test quality for `542d904`. No backend code changed, so Convex authorization review was not applicable. The independent skeptic confirmed the only candidate: returning `null` during restoration removed the prior labeled loading indicator. It classified this as a non-blocking P3 accessibility gap owned by section 7 rather than a failure of section 2 routing acceptance. No production code was edited during review.

## Operator-approved safe deferral

The operator approved safe deferral after the final section 1 review. This decision supersedes the prior run-wide block without weakening any security requirement:

- Signup/verification and reset are accepted as unavailable for this milestone because pinned 0.0.95 cannot meet the non-enumeration policy and signup also fails the concurrent-resend gate.
- Provider-owned non-atomic token persistence is documented as an inherited session-consistency limitation. A residual token remains subject to backend validation; this milestone does not fork or replace Convex Auth token storage.
- No code-generating email provider is enabled, so package DEBUG code logging is currently unreachable. Before a future provider is enabled, a bounded environment and observed-log check must be added.
- Routing, returning-user sign-in, profile onboarding, protected home, sign-out, and hardening may proceed. Reviewed feature-level deferrals advance rather than setting the whole run to `blocked`.

## Findings and decisions

- Password auth precedes social auth.
- Local verification/reset delivery uses secure six-digit codes printed only in local Convex logs.
- Resend, OAuth, groups, linked-method management, and production/cloud deployment are deferred.
- Password reset is gated on verified non-enumerating behavior from supported pinned APIs. The pinned 0.0.95 `reset` implementation currently fails this gate because absent and existing password accounts have observably different outcomes; keep reset unavailable pending a separately reviewed solution.
- Each feature uses red/green/refactor, then a fresh review, with at most two correction cycles.

## Historical corrections applied for review findings on `6e1024e`

1. The contract now requires both `AUTH_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and `AUTH_LOG_SECRETS=true` to remain unset for every code-generating run, including local console delivery, and records that the code-creation DEBUG call bypasses `maybeRedact`.
2. Section 3 keeps normalization, password guidance, and safe-error mapping in pure policy tests, moves duplicate-submit behavior to a focused submission state-machine test, and requires a bounded simulator double-tap wiring check.
3. Section 4 now separates backend code-lifecycle/concurrency tests from mobile verification-state tests and records a bounded SecureStore fault-injection simulator exception for provider-owned token writes.
4. The contract and plan add a concurrent-resend safety gate with a forced reversed-delivery-completion test; signup/resend remains unavailable unless the last delivered code is redeemable across overlapping clients and retries.
5. Lost-response and partial token-write states now require no protected navigation before success, discarded verification state, awaited best-effort sign-out, fail-closed restoration if cleanup fails, and normal password sign-in as the supported recovery. A fresh code and exactly-once completion are explicitly not promised.

## Historical final-review findings resolved by operator deferral

1. **Blocking — partial token persistence is not fail-closed on restart.** The pinned client writes access and refresh tokens sequentially, removes them sequentially during sign-out, restores from the access-token key alone, and considers any restored access token authenticated. If the refresh-token write fails and later access-token removal also fails, restart can render protected routes despite the contract's fail-closed claim. The contract would need pair-consistency or a durable quarantine plus selective write/remove/restart fault cases.
2. **Blocking — plaintext package logging lacks an executable verification owner.** The package directly logs verification-code creation arguments at DEBUG, while the section 4 strategy assigns no bounded check to verify local deployment logging configuration and observed output. A future strategy must prove the intended console provider is the only plaintext-code path or record a precise verification exception.

The accessibility candidate was rejected as outside this correction's diff scope: existing plan acceptance already covers labels, busy states, alerts, touch targets, font scaling, keyboard reachability, and non-color errors. Runtime VoiceOver, TalkBack, focus, announcement, Dynamic Type, and exact touch-target behavior remain future device-verification gaps, not findings on this documentation correction.

## Review coverage

Fresh read-only lenses covered architecture, simplicity, security/privacy, accessibility, adversarial behavior, product fit, test quality, Convex review, and the deterministic Convex authz scan. A separate skeptic confirmed both blocking findings and rejected the accessibility candidate. Review inspected the exact pinned source for logging, token writes/removals, restoration, and auth-state publication. No production code was edited, no deployment-affecting command was run, and runtime/device behavior remains unverified.

## Recovery note

If an invocation ends unexpectedly, inspect `git status`, `git diff`, `git log -5 --oneline`, this file, and the current checklist section. Do not assume the interrupted invocation succeeded or failed. Preserve valid partial tests and edits, rerun the smallest focused command, and continue only the current handoff transition.
